{"name":"SimpleDSFviewer","tagline":"DSF data analysis program for Matlab 2015","body":"SimpleDSFviewer is a program (or software running with Matlab Runtime) used to efficiently analyse data for differential scanning fluorimetry. The program can be downloaded at https://github.com/hscsun/SimpleDSFviewer.git.\r\n\r\nThis program includes a very detailed user instruction and example data, which is very useful for new users to pick up. The details about the data analysis theories and the program can be found in the following article: SimpleDSFviewer: a tool to analyse and view differential scanning fluorimetry data for characterising protein thermal stability and interactions (PeerJ PrePrints 3:e1937 https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1555v1).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
